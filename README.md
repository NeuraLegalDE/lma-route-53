# Route53/DNS base Setup for LMA using CDK

Route 53 Setup for LMA

Output -> A configured Route53 Setup for

dev.lma.neura-legal.de (used for Development)

and

lma.neura-legal.de (used for production)

## Prerequisites

* Node V20
* A working installation of [AWS CDK V2](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/).

### For deployments ony your local maschine

* A working install of the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
* Some way to get an AWS Session Token. For that [AWSume](https://awsu.me) is recommended

## Useful commands

* `cdk deploy`      deploys this stack
* `cdk diff`        compares deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
* `cdk destroy`     destroys this stack

## Doing a deployment from your local machine

- ```npm install```
- ```awsume [your_profile_name]```
- ```cdk deploy```

## CI Deployment

For the automatic deployment GitHub Actions are used. The proper configuration/script can be found [here](.github/workflows/ci.yml)

Every time there is a push to either the **main** branch or to **any** other branch a deployment of the stack is started.

**ATTENTION:** There is no difference between the main branch and any other branch. Everything is deployed to production and for development.

#### Automatic via CD (Continous Delivery)

The relevant Continous Delivery configuration is provided in this [file](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

Additionally a so called Dependabot is used to check for updated dependencies/libraries and merge them automatically to the main branch. The relevant configuration files can be found [here](./.github/dependabot.yml) and [here](./.github/automerge.yml).

**IMPORTANT:** To use automerge you have to  go to the repoâ€™s settings tab and turn on the "Allow auto-merge option" from the Pull Requests section:

![automerge.jpg](./documentation/images/automerge.jpg)

Additionally a so called branch protection has been setup so that a Pull-Request needs to be deployed to the DEVELOPMENT environment before it is valid to be merged. To achieve this the setting is as follows at the GitHub Project

![branch_protection.jpg](./documentation/images/branch_protection.jpg)

So the deploy job defined [here](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) must succeed before any Pull Request can be merged into the main branch.
